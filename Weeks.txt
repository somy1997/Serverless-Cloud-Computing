Weeks starting from 15 July 2019.

Week 1 : 

Met Sandip sir and sent a mail to sourav kanti addya (Post Doc Fellow) for setting up a weekly meeting and for keeping the first meeting to explain the objective of the MTP.

Week 2 :

Read summer intern's report on cloud computing.

Week 3 :

Replicating the summer intern's work.

Problems : 
The order of steps are not sequential.
Lambda function needs to be created before deploying GET API.
Also, for lambda function to work properly the corresponding database used in the lambda function must be created first.
In test email used "slcciitkgp@gmail.com" instead of keesara's email in 3.2.2 .
Instead of creating 2 separate API, created methods GET and POST associating with same lambda function in the same api my-api.
Instead of creating 2 separate lambda functions, created 1 lambda function and wrote the codes for both so that whichever one needs to be used, the others can be commented out.
But then commenting out was taking time, so created 2 lambda functions now for each method respectively. Deployed both on prod stage.
The DynamoDB has following entry :
{
  "EmailID": "janedoe@gmail.com",
  "FirstName": "Jane",
  "LastName": "Doe"
}
s3 bucket created with name customerdetails1
s3 bucket instructions are not in details and don't know what to do with the html code.
Don't have the files mentioned in 4.

Week 4 :

Creating IAM role for DynamoDB access through lambda official doc : https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/projects/build-serverless-web-app-lambda-apigateway-s3-dynamodb-cognito/module-3/
Creating proxy for lambda function official doc : https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-create-api-as-simple-proxy-for-lambda.html , actually its not completely correct, see the response to one of the comments : https://medium.com/p/51e88773827a/responses/show
Understanding callbacks : https://codeburst.io/javascript-what-the-heck-is-a-callback-aba4da2deced
While checking with sleep after callback : Response:
{
  "errorMessage": "2019-08-24T17:50:24.064Z c1d8bbbd-4ba7-4813-b536-be63b0872dfe Task timed out after 3.00 seconds"
}
So, fails if timeout set for > 3 seconds of total time.
